# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
ISS website is informative but unstructured, like all website experiences. Additionally we see that there is no sitemap to assist user navigation.

Our Chatbot is created to provide a human language conversational interface for contextual, and targeted access. 

We started the chatbot design keeping user centricity in mind. Identifying the use categories and their information knowledge expectations from a bot was key.

While the chatbot is designed for english only, we have considered different phrases, utterances and incomplete phrases to train the intents.

For easy information access we have considered slack and Google Assistant.

We have tried to create a dynamic system and hence automated scraping and associated database refresh is ensured.

Intents are central to the user interaction. We designed user journeys based on user interaction, and preserved the user conversation context between dialogue /conversation turns. Similar matching intents were “resolved” through prioritization. Additionally to “course correct” the user, fallback intents were designed with sufficient aids and trials to bring the user back to successful resolution of the queries.

In our opinion, today’s chat bot addresses user category: prospective student well. For the chatbot to truly serve the needs of current students, faculty, and collaborations e.g. research, recruiters, etc. we will need the bot to “crawl” and ingest relevant datasets. Per guidance from course instructors, we restricted ourselves to publicly available information. 

The roadmap of our chatbot has to consider following aspects: serving all user categories for ISS, omni-channel (facebook integration, Building BOT into ISS website), authentication (to prevent Denial of Service/DoS), and authentication based personalized interaction.
